            However, at night, these animatronics become hostile and roam the restaurant,

            the establishment via security cameras and other systems.

            The gameplay primarily involves surviving five nights by managing limited resources such as power for
            lights and security cameras while avoiding being attacked by the animatronics.
            The player must use strategic planning and quick reflexes to survive each night,
            as the animatronics become more aggressive and unpredictable as the game progresses.
